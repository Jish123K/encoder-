# encoder-
This code uses the cryptography library to encrypt files using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm. The obfuscate_file function takes a filename and a key, reads the contents of the file, encrypts the data using the key, and writes the encrypted data to a new file with a prefix of obfuscated_.

The encode_file function takes a filename, reads the contents of the file, encodes the data using base64, and writes a new Python script that imports the base64 module and executes base64.b64decode on the encoded data.

The main function is the main entry point for the script, which presents a menu to the user to either obfuscate or encode a file.
